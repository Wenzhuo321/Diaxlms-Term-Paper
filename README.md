Creating a README for your GitHub repository is a great way to introduce your project, guide visitors through using your code, and explain the significance of your datasets and findings. Below is a simple template you can customize to fit your project related to analyzing ChatGPT's understanding of the evolution of human language across different languages.

This repository contains the code and datasets used in our study to explore ChatGPT's understanding of the development of human language, spanning from ancient to modern times across five major languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, and German. Our research utilizes custom datasets to evaluate ChatGPT's comprehension and adaptability to linguistic changes over centuries.


### Datasets

We employ two custom-compiled datasets for this study:

1. **Historical and Modern Linguistic Comprehension Dataset**: Features 20 question-and-answer pairs for each targeted language, focusing on a variety of linguistic expressions from different time periods.
2. **Language Examination Questions Dataset**: Consists of 30 multiple-choice questions for each language, sourced from authoritative language assessments.

Both datasets aim to probe ChatGPT's capacity to understand and interpret language within diverse historical and contemporary contexts.
