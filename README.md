This repository contains the code and datasets used in our study to explore ChatGPT's understanding of the development of human language, spanning from ancient to modern times across five major languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, and German. Our research utilizes custom datasets to evaluate ChatGPT's comprehension and adaptability to linguistic changes over centuries.

Datasets
We employ two self-made datasets for this study:

Historical and Modern Linguistic Comprehension Dataset: Features 20 question-and-answer pairs for each targeted language, focusing on a variety of linguistic expressions from different time periods.
Language Examination Questions Dataset: Consists of 30 multiple-choice questions for each language, sourced from authoritative language assessments.
